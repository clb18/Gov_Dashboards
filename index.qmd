title: "Gov Dashboards"
---

This site contains reproducible dashboards built from government/statistical sources.

## Framework contract

Each indicator follows the same pipeline:

1. **API pull** → raw tibble
2. **Parse/clean** → standardized tibble: `date`, `value`, `series_id`, `label`, `freq`
3. **Visualization** → modular plot function returning a `ggplot` (optionally plotly)

## Notes
- Static charts by default (ggplot).
- Interactive charts are opt-in (plotly), controlled per dashboard.
